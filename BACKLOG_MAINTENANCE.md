# Backlog Maintenance Policy

This repository receives a high volume of installation/support requests mixed with actual driver defects.

This change introduces:
- Structured bug reporting templates (required distro/kernel/device/repro/logs)
- A default path to Discussions for support questions
- Automatic stale issue lifecycle for inactive threads

Goal: keep the issue tracker focused on actionable, reproducible defects and reduce maintenance drag.
